=== Blinking an LED
==== Problem
You want to make sure everything is set up by blinking an LED.

==== Solution
The 'hello, world' of the embedded world is to flash an LED. <<start_hello>> 
is some code that blinks the `USR3` LED five times using the PRU.

// TODO The *'s and _'s in the code are messing with the formatting.

[[start_hello]]
.hello.c
[source,c,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]

Later chapters will go into details of how this code works, but if you want 
to run it right now do the following.

-	copying firmware file /tmp/pru0-gen/hello.out to /lib/firmware/am335x-pru0-fw

Look quickly and you will see the `USR3` LED blinking.  

=== Note: 
To execute the program using the second PRU (PRU2), change PRUN=0 to PRUN=1
