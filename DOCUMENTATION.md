## Installation 

1. The `short-commands.sh` bash script present in `scripts` directory: <br> Run this `$ source short-commands.sh` command in the terminal.<br> On executing this command, some lines will be appended to the `.bashrc` file which is present in your user directory. The new .bashrc file will be installed the next time you log out and log back in, but if you want it installed now, you can just source the file. `$ source ~/.bashrc`
